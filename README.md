## Synopsis

This repo is a collection of small excel spreadsheets developed for my own personal use. 

## Tools

**Financial Calculator** - this tool has all the functions available on a regular financial calculator and some extras as well.

**Line of Credit Tracker** - this tool allows you to keep track of your line of credit payments. It also takes your last payment and shows you how long it would take you to pay of the balance assuming you continue making the same payments. Two sections are available, one if you are making monthly payments and the other if you are making bi-weekly payments

**Mutual Fund Comparison** - this tool asks you to enter yearly returns of a group of mutual funds you would like to compare. Then it shows each fund's return over the last 10 years, its risk (standard deviation), how it performed over the last 10 years in terms of real money and how it recovered from the crash in 2008.

**GPA Converter** - converts grades from the 4.3 system to the 4.0 system. Alls gives cumulative average, year average and last 2 years average

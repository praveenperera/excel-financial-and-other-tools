## Synopsis

This repo is a collection of small excel spreadsheets developed for my own personal use. Many of the tools have custom VBA functions to help with the calculations. 

## Tools

**Financial Calculator** - this tool has the functions available on a regular financial calculator to calculate FV, PV, INT and N as well as a few extras.

**Line of Credit Tracker** - this tool allows you to keep track of your line of credit payments. It also takes your last payment and shows you how long it would take you to pay of the balance assuming you continue making the same payments. Two sections are available, one if you are making monthly payments and the other if you are making bi-weekly payments

**Car Financing True Cost** - many car dealerships offer 0% or very low interest car loans. A lot of these places also offer cash discounts. This tool helps you figure out whether it would be better to finance the car through the dealership or through the bank taking the cash discount in consideration

**Mutual Fund Comparison** - this tool asks you to enter yearly returns of a group of mutual funds you would like to compare. Then it shows each fund's return over the last 10 years, its risk (standard deviation), how it performed over the last 10 years in terms of real money and how it recovered from the crash in 2008.

**Cash Back Calculator** - you enter your estimated monthly expenses in 4 categories and it calculates the cashback you would earn if you were to use a credit card with cashback rewards

**GPA Converter** - converts grades from the 4.3 system to the 4.0 system. Also gives cumulative average, year average and last 2 years average
